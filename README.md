# Graph Algorithm Visualizer

A Python-based desktop application for visualizing graph algorithms through an interactive interface using Tkinter. Designed for students and developers to better understand graph traversal and shortest path techniques through real-time, step-by-step feedback.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Interactive graph construction: add nodes and weighted edges by clicking
- Real-time visualizations for:
  - **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**
  - **DFS (Depth-First Search)**
  - **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm**
  - **Topological Sort**
- Color-coded animations showing node states, queue behavior, and shortest paths
- Distance labels and status indicators updated during execution
- Clean modular structure (`graph_ui.py`, `algorithms.py`, `main.py`) for easy maintenance and extension

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Tkinter** for GUI
- Custom implementations of graph algorithms (no third-party libraries used)

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

Built to:
- Help visualize and debug key graph algorithms
- Serve as an educational tool for CS students and interview prep
- Encourage interactive learning of traversal and pathfinding logic

## ðŸ‘¥ Collaborators

- **Thummaluri Nymish Kumar Reddy** ([@nymishreddy](https://github.com/nymishreddy))  
- **Harihara Varma** ([@Varma-99](https://github.com/Varma-99))

## ðŸ”® Future Improvements

- Add support for:
  - Union-Find / Disjoint Set Union
  - SPFA (Shortest Path Faster Algorithm)
  - Bellman-Ford Algorithm
- Graph save/load functionality
- Enhanced UI responsiveness and animations
